          artist and producer nosaj thing, aka jason chung, is an old friend. we met for the first time back in 2010 when OP-1 was revealed; chung was making beats on OP-1 for the ''make beats'' competition with stÃ¼ssy, and his first album, drift, had just been released. today, he's past his fifth record and stopping by stockholm for a long awaited visit after playing sÃ³nar in barcelona.
        </p>
        <p>
          his latest record, continua, is chung's first big collaborative effort, and a leap out of his comfort zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "as someone that just started making beats in the bedroomâ€¦ also being more introverted, it was a huge challenge for me to really step up as a producer and learn how to communicate with multiple personalities. this is also my first album with luckyme and dom who runs the labelâ€¦ i had like this dream list of artists i wanted to work with and he told me, ''hey, i hate to break it to you, but you're gonna have to send some dms.'' â€¦ i guess then i just understood that if you have this idea, you have this vision, and you want to work with someone, it is always going to mean more if you reach out directly. and a few of those were very difficult for me. i had drafts for a few weeks or even a month [before i sent them].
        </p>
        <p>
          "i think everyone on the record were artists i was already listening to for several years, so it was almost like this was the cast in a movie i had in mindâ€¦ so i just kind of already knew that it was going to work and fit."
        </p>
        <p>
          chung's cinematic intentions are clear throughout "continua". calling on artists well-versed in the realm of ethereal composition like julianna barwick and duval timothy, to notorious mood setters like toro y moi and coby sey, chung and his supporting cast have released one of the most lowkey survival soundtracks of the past year.
        </p>
        <p>
          this collaborative approach flowed from the studio to the records visual language, working with creative director eric hu, and calling in photographers phil nisco and donovan novotny for the music videos. the blueprint emerged from his production process, one that has always been inspired by moving image.
        </p>
        <p>
          "last year, we saw this film called 'memoria', and of course 'koyaanisqatsi'. i played that film a lot during this record, and i was just like, 'this movie came out in early 80s. what's our version? what can we do?' donovan is such a talented photographer, i just told him 'hey, just make video stills of what you do already.' he was just so hyped on that idea."
